This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 
This application is useful for users who have busy schedules and want to able to manage their time
more effectively at a glance! 

Using this application is simple. The user just has to map out their schedule for the day and
click the save button (floppy disk) that way all their daily events will be saved and stored in 
local storage so they do not have to worry about the page refreshing. All their info will still 
be displayed and color coated to indicate whether the event is past, present, or in the future.
